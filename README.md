# ASVAA IT — School Management Portal

A full-stack school management portal built with **Vite + React** (frontend), **Node.js + Express** (backend API), and **MongoDB** (database).

## Features

- **School onboarding**: create your school by name first — this automatically provisions a dedicated MongoDB database for that school and issues a short school code (e.g. `GREENWOOD-4821`)
- **Multi-tenant by design**: every school's students, teachers, classes, attendance, fees and users live in their own isolated database; nothing is shared between schools except the lightweight school registry
- JWT authentication with roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `student`, `parent` — login/registration require the school code so the correct tenant database is used
- Student records (admission, class assignment, guardian details)
- Teacher records (employee ID, subjects, qualifications)
- Class / section management with class teacher assignment
- Daily attendance marking per class, with per-student summaries
- Fee tracking with partial payments and status (pending / partial / paid / overdue)
- School notice board with pinning and audience targeting
- Clean navy & gold dashboard UI, responsive down to mobile

## How the multi-tenant setup works

1. **`POST /api/schools`** — the very first step. Takes just a school name (plus optional address/contact info), generates a unique school code and a dedicated database name, and stores that mapping in a small **master database** (`asvaa_master`).
2. **`POST /api/auth/register`** and **`POST /api/auth/login`** — both require a `schoolCode` in the request body. The server looks up that code in the master database, then opens (or reuses a cached) connection to that specific school's database before creating/checking the user.
3. **Every authenticated request** — the JWT issued at login embeds the school's ID. The `protect` middleware reads that, looks up the school, and attaches `req.tenantModels` (Student, Teacher, ClassRoom, Attendance, Fee, Notice, User) bound to that school's own database. Controllers never talk to a hardcoded model — they always use whatever tenant the current request belongs to.

This means two schools can have staff with the same email address, identical admission numbers, or classes named "Grade 8 - A" without ever colliding — they're physically separate databases under the hood, unified only by the school code you use to sign in.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB instance (local install or a free MongoDB Atlas cluster) — set `MONGO_URI` to the **base** connection string, without a database name at the end (e.g. `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` or `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net`). The app appends database names itself (`asvaa_master` for the registry, and a generated name per school).

### 1. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set MONGO_URI + JWT_SECRET
npm install
npm run dev        # starts on http://localhost:6000
```

### 2. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev         # starts on http://localhost:5175, proxies /api to :6000
```

### 3. Set up your school and create your first account

Open `http://localhost:5175` — you'll land on **Create your school**. Enter a school name and submit; you'll get back a school code (e.g. `GREENWOOD-4821`). Keep that code — you'll use it to register and to log in. From there, continue to **Create your admin account**, then sign in and start adding classes, teachers, and students.

## API overview

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. `/schools` and `/auth/register` + `/auth/login` are public; everything else requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Notes on production readiness

This is a solid MVP foundation. Before going live, consider:

- Adding request validation (e.g. `zod` or `joi`) on all controllers
- Rate limiting and helmet for the Express app
- Password reset / email verification flows
- File uploads for student/teacher avatars (e.g. via S3 or Cloudinary)
- Pagination on list endpoints for large datasets
- Automated tests (Jest/Vitest + Supertest)
- HTTPS + environment-specific CORS origins in production
